Hi there! My name is [Enrico Lattuada](https://enrico-lattuada.com/) and I am a Scientific Python Developer at [Zuru Tech](https://zuru.tech/).

I previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Faculty of Physics](https://physik.univie.ac.at/en/) of the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/) and at the [Physics Department](https://www.phys.uniroma1.it/fisica/en) of the [University of Rome La Sapienza](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/). 
My research focused on experimental soft matter physics, with the investigation of complex colloidal suspensions using advanced optical techniques, and the development of high-performance codes for experiment analysis.
